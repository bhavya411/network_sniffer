# Network Sniffer

Network Sniffer is a tool designed to capture and analyze network traffic. It provides insights into the data packets being exchanged over a network, helping you understand the communication patterns, troubleshoot issues, and ensure the security of your network.

## Features

- **Packet Capture:** Capture network packets in real-time or from stored pcap files.
- **Protocol Analysis:** Analyze different network protocols and their payloads.
- **Traffic Visualization:** Visualize network traffic patterns using graphs and charts.
- **Filtering:** Apply filters to focus on specific types of traffic or protocols.
- **Security Monitoring:** Detect suspicious or malicious activity in the network traffic.
- **Export:** Export captured data and analysis reports for further examination.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Network Sniffer on your local machine. 

1. **Prerequisites:** List any software, libraries, or dependencies that need to be installed.

2. **Installation:** Provide step-by-step installation instructions, including how to clone the repository and install any required packages.

3. **Usage:** Explain how to run the network sniffer, its command-line options, and configuration settings.
